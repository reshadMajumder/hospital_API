## Admin Panel üéõÔ∏è

- URL: `/admin/`
- Login: Use the superuser credentials.

To create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## Media Files üì∑

Uploaded doctor images are stored in the `media/` directory. During development, ensure that `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` are correctly configured in your `settings.py`:
```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
```

Add the following to your `urls.py` to serve media files locally:
```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

---

## Testing ‚úÖ

Run tests using the following command:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

---

## Deployment üöÄ

For production, use a server like **Gunicorn** with **Nginx**. Switch the database to PostgreSQL or MySQL for better performance.

1. **Collect Static Files**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

2. **Use `.env` for production settings** (set `DEBUG=False`).
